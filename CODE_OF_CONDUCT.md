# Code of Conduct

**TL;DR**: Be friendly, inclusive, respectful, and mindful of your fellow collaborators.

## Everyone's Responsibilities

As a contributor (commenter, code collaborator, feedback-provider, and so on), you are expected to:

- Maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment.
- Respect all other individuals regardless of different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.

### Inclusion

This project and community will be a harassment-free experience for every collaborator regardless of age, appearance,
disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education,
socioeconomic status, nationality, race, religion, sexual identity, or sexual orientation.

### Professionalism

Of course, friendly language may result in acceptable banter between collaborators. So what is acceptable and what
is not? As a base example:

- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances are unacceptable.
- Attacks on a person for any reason is unacceptable.

## Team Inkling's Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for overseeing the standards of acceptable behaviour within this project. This means we
can and will edit, reject, and delete pull requests and issues if we can cite instances of unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope

If you are representing the project or its community, we expect you to follow by the Code of Conduct. The scope of the
Code may also be extended to verifiable public interactions and/or personal interactions if they cannot be resolved
internally.

## Enforcement

You can send reports of Code-infringing behaviour directly to staff.

We are obligated to:

- Follow our own Code of Conduct.
- Maintain confidentiality concerning the reporter.
- Provide a response to the reporter.
- Provide transparency in verdict decision-making.

Verdicts handed out to contributors include (but are not limited to) requests for apology, warnings, organisation-wide
temporary bans, and permanent bans.
